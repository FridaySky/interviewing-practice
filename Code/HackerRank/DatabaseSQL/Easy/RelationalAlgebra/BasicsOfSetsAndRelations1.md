**Type: Databases > Relational Algebra**  
**Difficulty Level: Easy**

### Problem Statement
You are given two sets.
Set **A** = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set **B** = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
How many elements are present in **A ⋃ B**?

### Answer
The set union of **A** and **B** are all elements present in _either_ **A** _or_ **B**. Keep in mind that there cannot be duplicate elements in a set, so only account for each element once.

Set **A ⋃ B** = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Therefore, there are eight elements.
