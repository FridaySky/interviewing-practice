**Type: Databases > Relational Algebra**  
**Difficulty Level: Easy**

### Problem Statement
You are given two sets.
Set **A** = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set **B** = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
How many elements are present in the set difference **A - B**?

### Answer
To compute the set difference of **A** and **B**, find all elements of **A** that are not elements of **B**. In other words, elements must be in **A**, but they cannot be in **B**.

Set **A - B** = {1}

Therefore, there is only one element.
