# Basic of Sets and Relations #1
**Type: Databases > Relational Algebra**  
**Difficulty Level: Easy**

### Problem Statement
You are given two sets.
Set **A** = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set **B** = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
How many elements are present in **A ∩ B**?

### Answer
The set intersection of **A** and **B** are all elements that are present in _both_ **A** and **B**. Any element that is not shared by both set operands must be excluded.

Set **A ∩ B** = {2,3,4,5,6}

Therefore, there are five elements.
