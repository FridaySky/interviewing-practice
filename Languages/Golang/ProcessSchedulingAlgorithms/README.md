# Process Scheduling Algorithms
This was a program written in the summer of 2018 for the class *Operating Systems* taught by Professor Michael McAlpin at the University of Central Florida. The assignment criteria is given in the file *pa1.pdf*.

Note that *pa1* stands for *Programming Assignment 1*.

## Compiling on Ubuntu
This program was written in adherance to GCC 7.3.0 which supports C11. To compile, write into the terminal (once inside the *pa1* folder):

`go build`

## Running on Ubuntu
`./pa1 c2-fcfs.in c2-fcfs.stu`

In this example, *c2-fcfs.in* is an input file found within this folder. However, *c2-fcfs.stu* is an output file generated by the program. This output file can be in a `diff` command against the file *c2-fcfcs.base* which can be found within this folder.

To run the script to test all of these programs, run this command:

`./pa1Test.sh`

If the program is successful, no output will be generated on the terminal screen.

## Last Remarks
This code was rushed, and the code is inefficient because I opted to write a slow bubble sort algorithm because it was easier.
